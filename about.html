    <h1 class="underline">About me</h1>
    <h3 class="double-space">Hi, I'm John Solo! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a
      <span class="emphasize"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer" class="word-link" target="_blank">Software Engineer</a></span>
      from California, and my main technical focuses are full-stack web development and cloud infrastructure.
    </h3>

    <h3 class="double-space">I am a proud alumni of 
      <span class="emphasize-red"><a href="https://www.cs.csustan.edu/" class="word-link" target="_blank">California State University, Stanislaus,</a></span>
      where I graduated Magna Cum Laude and received the 
      <span class="emphasize"><a href="https://www.csustan.edu/university-news?merit_story_id=30904815" class="word-link" target="_blank">Outstanding Student Achiever Award</a></span>
      for Computer Science.
      This honor is awarded annually to only one graduating student per major for being the most exceptional student in their respective program.
      <br>
      In addition, I also was the Computer Science Club president for Fall 2018, with the
      organization growing to host multiple hackathons,
      <span class="emphasize-red"><a href="https://stanhacks2020.devpost.com/" class="word-link" target="_blank">StanHacks,</a></span>
      and striving to match club members with
      wonderful opportunities.
      
    </h3>

    <h3 class="double-space">
      In terms of my own hackathon experiences, my friends and I won the
      <span class="emphasize-yellow"><a href="https://devpost.com/software/social-map" class="word-link" target="_blank">Best Google Cloud Platform</a></span>
      and
      <span class="emphasize-yellow"><a href="https://devpost.com/software/social-map" class="word-link" target="_blank">Best Social Media Prize</a></span>
      awards at HackMerced.
      My favorite part of the hackathon was being able to bring our ideas into fruition while also learning industry-leading technologies.
      We built a full-stack web application that allowed users to annotate the in-browser map with what was happening in their area. 
      This app works similiar to Waze or Neighbors by Ring.

    </h3>

    <h3 class="double-space">Lastly, I spent a summer as a Software Engineering Intern at
      <span class="emphasize-red"><a href="https://www.verizonconnect.com/" class="word-link" target="_blank">Verizon Connect</a></span>
      in Atlanta, Georgia! I was part of the video ingestion team where I built scalable RESTful APIs 
      on 
      <span class="emphasize-red"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" class="word-link" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services.</a></span>
      The services I helped build were able to transcode dashcam videos and allow 
      customers to view them on their mobile devices. 
      This was an exciting opportunity because I learned a lot about how IoT devices can be 
      used to improve driver safety with video-based coaching. There was also so much to explore in
      Atlanta, and I definitely miss the food there.
